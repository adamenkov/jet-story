# Jet-Story

For about a decade this was my playground for game programming, C++ programming, Typescript programming and whatnot.

Now it's time to say goodbye.

Remake of the ZX Spectrum game "Jet-Story" (http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002612).

Implemented almost everything except for AI behaviour, which I want to be *exactly like in the original game*.

DirectX SDK June 2010 is needed to build the game.
