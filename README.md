# Jet-Story

This is strictly my hobby and playground - no obligations, no timeframes.

Remake of the ZX Spectrum game "Jet-Story" (http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002612).

Implemented almost everything except for AI behaviors, which I want to be *exactly like in the original game*.

DirectX SDK June 2010 is needed to build the game.
